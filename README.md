A professional web interface designed to visualize and document the **Killpips Integrated Operational Model**, a suite of advanced market structure tools for conscious trading.

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a high-performance, aesthetically premium static website that serves as the documentation and visualization hub for the KVO (Killpips Volume Operational) ecosystem. It features a modern, dark-themed "glassmorphism" design with 3D animated elements, responsive layouts, and interactive scroll reveals.
